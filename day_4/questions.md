## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method allows a coder to write just a handful of lines of code when they have a piece of code that needs to be run multiple times, as opposed to writing a piece of code multiple times.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello(phrase)
  puts "#{phrase}"
end

hello("Sam I am")
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts ""{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Sam")
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
I would type into the terminal `ruby questions.rb`, if this were an `.rb` file.

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
I don't think I have any right now!
